*Take a big time playing Minecraft. Try crafting and mining. WASD to move, T to chat, and ESC to exit.*
# If you are in Chromebook: 
You should **tap** install when playing **Minecraft**. You may do this if you enabled Crostini. Playing Minecraft means you need Crostini, aka Linux Envirorment.
## How to do:
- Tap Linux Enviroment and do the on-screen steps.
- Tap the Install button.
## Installation

### Step 1: Download Forge
1. Go to the official Forge website.
2. Choose the correct Minecraft version.
3. Click **Installer** under **Download Latest**.

> **Note:** Wait for the file to download. This may take **30–45 seconds**.

---

### Step 2: Run the Installer
1. Open your **Downloads** folder.
2. Double-click the file:
3. Select **Install client**.
4. Click **OK** and wait for the confirmation message.

---

### Step 3: Launch Minecraft
1. Open the **Minecraft Launcher**.
2. Select the **Forge** profile.
3. Click **Play**.

---

### Optional: Installing Mods
1. Press `Win + R`, type `%appdata%`, and press Enter.
2. Open the `.minecraft` folder.
3. Open the `mods` folder (create it if it doesn’t exist).
4. Place mod `.jar` files into the folder.
5. Launch Minecraft using the **Forge** profile.
# In Eaglercraft, or Minecraft Web Edition:
You may run it only on these websites, **[eaglercraft.dev](https://eaglercraft.dev/)** and **[mcraft.fun](https://www.mcraft.fun)** .
You may **create a world** or **join a server**.
### Here are the key moments about these websites.
1. You can create worlds in Eaglercraft, but in Web Edition, you can make them even in other Minecraft versions, but no 1.12.2.
2. You can join a server in Eaglercraft, but in Web Edition, they make servers from versions and test them and anyone joins, they think they are in a different version (eg: 1.21.6).
# Best game: **Minecraft Web Edition**
