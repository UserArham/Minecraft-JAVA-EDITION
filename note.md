# Note:
I am a bit **lazy** to do Version 3, because I am so tired and was **almost** able to quit updating Minecraft Java Edition today. I updated README.md and was feeling delusional and tired.
# Here is the key moments I did:
I did add:
1. index.html renaming
2. Favicon.ico added
3. Resolution quality (720p-1440p)
4. 64-bit quality and 16x16 3D interface
5. HTML/SCSS/JS/JSON added
6. IFRAME sized as 900x700
7. Java added with JavaScript and IFRAME
# END OF NOTE.MD
